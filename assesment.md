- ## **Dashboard Check:**

* Is this trading dashboard similar to the one posted at [https://thetadog.io/tntcharts/\#charts](https://thetadog.io/tntcharts/#charts)?

thetadog.io website is not available, not possible to check.


* Please explain some bugs in the trading dashboard.

1. Table header is sticky, but when scrolling down it not working properly. Can be solved through CSS or JS code changes.
2. The Token table don't do anything, but it was planned to be used as filter. Can be solved through JS code changes.
3. AboutPage Component, DetailPage Component not implemented yet.
4. Links below don't do anything, functionality not implemented yet
5. Advertize header on the top takes place and it seems ugly, like in cheapest trading platforms. Can be removed from the design.
6. Trading dashboard don't have any functionality to trade tokens, so there is no need to implement it.
7. Trading dashboard not too responsible as it awaited.

- ## **Permissions Check:**

* Have all the necessary permissions been granted (e.g., token price, “TRADE ON THETASWAP”, etc.) for the trading process to work smoothly?

The dashboard don't offer functionality to trade tokens, so there is no permission needed.


- ## **Landing Page Animation Feedback:**

* What’s your take on the animations currently on the landing page?

I see the fast running row, like in old trading movies or tv news. It looks cool, but it is not needed at all.

* Do you feel they enhance the user experience, or are they distracting and in need of improvement?

Animation is to fast and Animated elements can not be used directly, because it -> this element not possible to use.

* Let me know your thoughts about animation on the page.

For opening/close Token-table can be applied smooth animation to make it more user friendly.
